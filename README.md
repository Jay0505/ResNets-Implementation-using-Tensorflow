# ResNets-Implementation-using-Tensorflow

This project is aimed at solving the kaggle challenge namely "Painter by Numbers". The dataset is downloaded from kaggle itself. 

I aimed to determine the artist pertaining to a painting by employing Residual Networks (ResNets). I used Tensorflow to program ResNets from Scracth and in this project I used 34-layer ResNets (64, 128, 256, 512) - no_of_filters and (6, 8, 12, 6) - no_of_residual_blocks. 

First, I resized the image to the size of 224 * 224 with 3 channels.
